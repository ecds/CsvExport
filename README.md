# CSV Export

By University of Toronto Libraries

Modifications made by the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship

This plugin adds the CSV export format to items in Omeka Classic 2.3+ and collections in Omeka Classic 2.5+. Exported CSV files are compatible with the [CSV Import plugin](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/csv-import/).

The modifications make it possible to:

- export all the items instead of ten at a time
- export the original filename without the accompanying url

## System Requirements

- Omeka Classic 2.5+ (only items support the export format in Omeka Classic 2.3 and 2.4)
- PHP 5+
- MySQL 5.5+

## Optional Requirements

CSV Export can integrate with [IIIF Toolkit with Mirador](https://github.com/utlib/IiifItems), exporting annotation items along with the item they are attached to.
